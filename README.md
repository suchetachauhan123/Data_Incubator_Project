# A small draft of a Project:

# Discussion:
## Two problem statement has been discussed:
#### Problem statement 1: Develop a CNN-based model for Predicting patients with Schizophrenia using MRI images. 
#### Problem statement 2: Develop a CNN-based model to predict the gender of a person using MRI images.

## Data Collection: For the given problem, The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) data is used. An anatomical MR images from 72 patients with Schizophrenia and 75 healthy controls (ages ranging from 18 to 65 in each group) has been utilized. Link to public description of data source. http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html
### CNN model is trained on the above dataset using k-fold cross validation scheme. 
### For problem statement 1, all file prefixed with 'patient_' and for Problem statement 2, all filed prefixed with 'gender_'
